Defined in: [packages/actions/src/Call/CallResult.ts:31](https://github.com/evmts/tevm/blob/main/packages/actions/src/Call/CallResult.ts#L31)

Result of a TEVM VM Call method.

## Example

```typescript
import { createClient } from 'viem'
import { createTevmTransport, tevmCall } from 'tevm'
import { optimism } from 'tevm/common'
import { CallResult } from 'tevm/actions'

const client = createClient({
  transport: createTevmTransport({}),
  chain: optimism,
})

const callParams = {
  data: '0x...',
  bytecode: '0x...',
  gasLimit: 420n,
}

const result: CallResult = await tevmCall(client, callParams)
console.log(result)
```
