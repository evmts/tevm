	 *
	 * - `chain`: all chains supported by `Common` or a custom chain
	 * - `hardfork`: `mainnet` hardforks from `chainstart` (Frontier) through `osaka`
	 * - `eips`: `2537` (usage e.g. `eips: [ 2537, ]`)
	 *
	 * Note: check the associated EVM instance options
	 * documentation for supported EIPs.
	 *
	 * ### Default Setup
	 *
	 * Default setup if no `Common` instance is provided:
	 *
	 * - `chain`: `mainnet`
	 * - `hardfork`: `prague`
	 * - `eips`: `[]`
